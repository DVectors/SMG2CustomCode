# SMG2 Project Template
You can find here the source code for all custom coded objects and changes featured in the **SMG2 Project Template**. Compiled builds and the actual download can be found under **Releases**. Detailed information about the additions can be found on [my website](https://aurumsmods.com/pt).

## Building
To build the custom code binaries, you have to run the **build.py** script. However, you need to prepare the following things first:
- Install the ``elftools`` Python package
- Put the CodeWarrior executables in ``deps/CodeWarrior``
- Put the Kamek executable in ``deps/Kamek``

Unfortunately, you have to supply CodeWarrior and Kamek yourself.
